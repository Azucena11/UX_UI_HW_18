              <h1> About Me</h1>

               <p> I started out as an Accountant but I canâ€™t talk to 
                   numbers the way I love to talk to people. I am fluent in 
                   emoji and have a PHD in Memeology. My passion is 
                   finding pain points, solving problems and 
                   brainstorming user-centric solutions. Really... what is 
                   the nitty gritty of it all?</p>

    <h1> Qualitative Research</h1>

     <p>My first career was a sociologist, which 
         allowed me to gain a great deal of 
         experience conducting in-depth 
         interviews and qualitative research 
         methods. </p>

         <h1> Prototyping</h1>

         <p>In my first UX designer project I had 
             the opportunity to perfect my 
             prototyping skills. My favorite tools are 
             Miro and Figma. </p>

             <h1> UX/UI Design </h1>

         <p>In 2021, I took an in-depth UX/UI course 
             to improve my UX/UI design skills. </p>

    <h1> What I do when I'm not working</h1>

              <img src="Images\Potato Avatar.png" alt="Avatar Image 2">

               <p> If you can't find me looking at user pain points like 
                   NEO sees the Matrix, you can catch me working out, 
                   making memes, overdosing on coffee or posting my 
                   favorite H-E-B products on Instagram.</p>
